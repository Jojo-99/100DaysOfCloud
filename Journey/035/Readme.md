## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- An Azure AD tenant can have multiple subscriptions but an Azure subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant.

- You can change the Azure AD tenant to which an Azure subscription is associated.

- If your subscription expires, you **lose access** to all the other resources associated with the subscription. However, the Azure AD directory **remains** in Azure. You can associate and manage the directory using a different Azure subscription.

## Azure resource 
- An Azure resource can have multiple Delete locks.

- An Azure resource inherits locks from its resource group.

- If an Azure resource has a Read-only lock, you can add a Delete lock to the resource.
