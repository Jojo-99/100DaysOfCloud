## PaaS solution 
- A PaaS solution does **not** provide access to the operating system. The Azure Web Apps service provides an environment for you to host your web applications. Behind the scenes, the web apps are hosted on virtual machines running IIS. However, you have **no** direct access to the virtual machine, the operating system or IIS.
- A PaaS solution that hosts web apps in Azure does provide the **ability to scale the platform automatically**. This is known as **autoscaling**. Behind the scenes, the web apps are hosted on virtual machines running IIS. Autoscaling means adding more load balanced virtual machines to host the web apps.
- PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. PaaS development tools can cut the time it takes to code new apps with pre-coded application components built into the platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, search and so on.
- **Azure App Service** and **Azure SQL databases** are examples of Azure PaaS solutions.

## SaaS
- SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).nd so on.
- SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider's data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well.
- **Azure App Service** is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that lets you create web and mobile apps for any platform or device and connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises. App Service includes the web and mobile capabilities that were previously delivered separately as Azure Websites and Azure Mobile Services.

## IaaS
- **Azure Storage accounts** are an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) service.
