# Azure cloud concepts - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS 

## IaaS
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. 

The IaaS service provider manages the infrastructure, while you **purchase, install, configure**, and **manage** your own software.

- **Azure Storage accounts** are an IaaS service.

## PaaS solution 
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. 
PaaS includes infrastructure -- servers, storage, and networking -- but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more. 
PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.
- A PaaS solution does **not** provide access to the operating system. 
- A PaaS solution that hosts web apps in Azure does provide the **ability to scale the platform automatically**. This is known as **autoscaling**. 
- PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. PaaS development tools can cut the time it takes to code new apps with pre-coded application components built into the platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, search and so on.
- **Azure App Service**, **Azure SQL databases**, **Azure SQL databases** are examples of Azure PaaS solutions.


## SaaS
You are responsible for **configuring** the SaaS solution. 
- SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.
- Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).nd so on.
- SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider.
