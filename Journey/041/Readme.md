## Azure Advisor
Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to **optimize** your Azure deployments. 

It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions that can help you improve the cost-effectiveness, performance, high availability, and security of your Azure resources.

Azure Advisor displays security recommendations.
Azure Advisor provides you with a consistent, consolidated view of recommendations for all your Azure resources. It integrates with Azure Security Center to bring you security recommendations. You can get security recommendations from the Security tab on the Advisor dashboard.

Examples of recommendations include restricting access to virtual machines by configuring Network Security Groups, enabling storage encryption, installing vulnerability assessment solutions.

## Azure Security Center
Security Center helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. It periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations. The recommendations guide you through the process of configuring the controls you need.

The advanced monitoring capabilities in Security Center also let you **track and manage compliance and governance** over time. The overall compliance provides you with a measure of how much your subscriptions are compliant with policies associated with your workload.
